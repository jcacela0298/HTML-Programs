I worked on a Gourmet Sweets Store website that contains various functionality for client interaction.

If you would like a tutorial on how to correctly upload/download Java Eclipse projects to/from GitHub, check out my YouTube video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qCrTzBX3OOg&t=2s

To use and interact with this website, download the files and make sure they are in the same folder. Then, right-click on the "pc_home.html" file and click "Copy as Path". Then, go to your web browser and in the search bar type the following:

file:///[and then paste the path that you copied, making sure to exclude the quotation marks]

Here is an example:

file:///C:\Users\Santa\Desktop\Gourmet Sweets Website\pc_home.html

Press enter and you will be taken to the website.

During this project, I learned about how to manipulate grids, space on the page, types of positioning (absolute, relative, etc), stacking, overall layout/appearance, float, positioning coordinates, padding, and basic HTML syntax.
