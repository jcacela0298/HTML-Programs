I worked on a Gourmet Sweets Store website that contains various functionality for client interaction.

To use and interact with this website, download the files and make sure they are in the same folder. Then, click on the "pc_home.html" file so it opens in your browser.

During this project, I learned about how to manipulate grids, space on the page, types of positioning (absolute, relative, etc), stacking, overall layout/appearance, float, positioning coordinates, padding, and basic HTML syntax.
