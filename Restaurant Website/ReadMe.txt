I built a Thai Restaurant website that contains various functionality for client interaction.

If you would like a tutorial on how to correctly upload/download projects to/from GitHub into Eclipse with a Java example check out my YouTube video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qCrTzBX3OOg&t=2s

To use and interact with this website, download the files and make sure they are in the same folder. Then, right-click on the "ct_start.html" file and click "Copy as Path". Then, go to your web browser and in the search bar type the following:

file:///[and then paste the path that you copied, making sure to delete the quotation marks]

Here is an example:

file:///C:\Users\Santa\Desktop\Restaurant Website\ct_start.html

Press enter and you will be taken to the website.



During this project I learned about HTML history, attributes, elements, lists, navigation items, image files, hyperlinks, clicking to redirect client to another page, paragraphs, headers, <!DOCTYPE html>, footers, body, UTL encoding, alt, metadata, mandatory components, documentation and best practices, and basic HTML syntax.
