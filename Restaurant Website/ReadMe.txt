I worked on a Thai Restaurant website that contains various functionality for client interaction.

To use and interact with this website, download the files and make sure they are in the same folder. Then, click on the "ct_start.html" file to open it in your browser.

During this project I learned about HTML history, attributes, elements, lists, navigation items, image files, hyperlinks, clicking to redirect clients to another page, paragraphs, headers, <!DOCTYPE html>, footers, body, UTL encoding, alt, metadata, mandatory components, documentation and best practices, and basic HTML syntax.
