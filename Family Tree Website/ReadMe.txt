I worked on a Family Tree website that contains various functionality for client interaction.

To use and interact with this website, download the files and make sure they are in the same folder. Then, click on the "tb_komatsu.html" file so it opens in your browser.

During this project I learned more about how to add figure boxes, background textures, background images, three-dimensional effects, making the page content appear to jump out of the browser window, drop shadows around text strings and element boxes, color gradient in which one color gradually blends into another color or fades away if transparent colors are used, linear gradients, radial gradients, hotspots & applying image mapping to an image, and basic HTML syntax.
