I worked on a Family Tree website that contains various functionality for client interaction.

If you would like a tutorial on how to correctly upload/download Java Eclipse projects to/from GitHub, check out my YouTube video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qCrTzBX3OOg&t=2s

To use and interact with this website, download the files and make sure they are in the same folder. Then, right click on the "tb_komatsu.html" file and click "Copy as Path". Then, go to your web browser and in the search bar type the following:

file:///[and then paste the path that you copied, making sure to exclude the quotation marks].

Here is an example:

file:///C:\Users\Santa\Desktop\Family Tree Website\tb_komatsu.html

Press enter and you will be taken to the website, where you can click on the faces of the family members and be taken to their respective pages.

During this project I learned more about how to add figure boxes, background textures, background images, three-dimensional effects, making the page content appear to jump out of the browser window, drop shadows around text strings and element boxes, color gradient in which one color gradually blends into another color or fades away if transparent colors are used, linear gradients, radial gradients, hotspots & applying image mapping to an image, and basic HTML syntax.
