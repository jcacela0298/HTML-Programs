I worked on a Radio Station website that contains various functionality for client viewing and interaction.

To use and interact with this website, download the files and make sure they are in the same folder. Then, click on the "tf_home.html" file so it opens in your browser.

During this project, I learned more about tables and columns and how to manipulate their rows, columns, colors, size,  footer, font, spanning columns and rows, collapsed vs separate borders, responsive design, and basic HTML syntax.
