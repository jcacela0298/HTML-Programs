I worked on a Daycare website that contains various functionality for client interaction.

If you would like a tutorial on how to correctly upload/download Java Eclipse projects to/from GitHub, check out my YouTube video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qCrTzBX3OOg&t=2s

To use and interact with this website, download the files and make sure they are in the same folder. Then, right click on the "tf_home.html" file and click "Copy as Path". Then, go to your web browser and in the search bar type the following:

file:///[and then paste the path that you copied, making sure to exclude the quotation marks].

Here is an example:

file:///C:\Users\Santa\Desktop\Daycare Website\tf_home.html

Press enter and you will be taken to the website.

During this project, I was very interested to learn about making media queries, responsive design, nav-menu pulldown menus, flexboxes, print style sheets, page breaks, basic HTML syntax, and more. I especially appreciated this project because these days especially it is a necessity for us to be able to make the websites accessible via mobile, tablet, and desktop with media queries.
