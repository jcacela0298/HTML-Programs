I worked on a Daycare website that contains various functionality for client interaction.

To use and interact with this website, download the files and make sure they are in the same folder. Then, click on the "tf_home.html" file so it opens in your browser.

During this project, I was very interested in learning about making media queries, responsive design, nav-menu pulldown menus, flexboxes, print style sheets, page breaks, basic HTML syntax, and more. I especially appreciated this project because these days it is a necessity for us to be able to make the websites accessible via mobile, tablet, and desktop with media queries.
