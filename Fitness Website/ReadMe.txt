I built a Fitness Website called Tri and Succeed Sports that contains various functionality for client interaction.

To use and interact with this website, download the files and make sure they are in the same folder. Then, right-click on the "tss_home_txt.html" file and click "Copy as Path". Then, go to your web browser and in the search bar type the following:

file:///[and then paste the path that you copied, making sure to delete the quotation marks]

Here is an example:

file:///C:\Users\Santa\Desktop\Fitness Website\tss_home_txt.html

Press enter and you will be taken to the website.

If you would like a brief demo & tutorial, here is a link to my YouTube video: https://youtu.be/SsRl5t3_P8I



During this project I learned about HTML history, attributes, elements, lists, navigation items, image files, hyperlinks, clicking to redirect client to another page, paragraphs, headers, <!DOCTYPE html>, footers, body, UTL encoding, alt, metadata, mandatory components, documentation and best practices, and basic HTML syntax.
