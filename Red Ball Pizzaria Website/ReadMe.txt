I worked on a Pizzaria website that contains various functionality for client interaction.

To use and interact with this website, download the files and make sure they are in the same folder. Then, click on the "rb_survey.html" file so it opens in your browser.

During this project, I learned more about basic HTML syntax, and how to create a survey form with features such as labels, input boxes, selection lists, sliders, spinners, buttons, form buttons, validation rules, styles, and more.
