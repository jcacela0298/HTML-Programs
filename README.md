For HTML and CSS, I am most proud of my most recent Animal Adoption Website. There is various functionality for client interaction, and during this project, I learned more about headers, inserting images, articles, page organization, website scalability, web forms, submission buttons, tables, table-spanning, visual effects such as transformation and gradients, and basic HTML syntax. I employ all of my code organization & readability techniques that I have learned in HTML + CSS along the way.
