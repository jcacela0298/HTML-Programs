I worked on a Pet Adoption website called Adopt-An-Animal.com that contains various functionality for client interaction.

To use and interact with this website, download the files and make sure they are in the same folder. Then, click on the "AdoptAnAnimal.html" file so it opens in your browser.

During this project, I learned more about headers, inserting images, articles, page organization, website scalability, web forms, submission buttons, tables, table-spanning, visual effects such as transformation and gradients, and basic HTML syntax.
